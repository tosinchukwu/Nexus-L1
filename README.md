You earn NEX Points by contributing compute and interacting with the Nexus ecosystem.

---

### Can I use multiple devices?
* Yes, you can connect as many devices as you want, including desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and servers
* You can link and manage all your devices from a single Nexus account.
* You can also prove computations in multiple browser tabs simultaneously.

## --> One-click-deployment 
1- Register in [Mintair](https://mintair.xyz/onboarding?ref=EF5V-UYBN)

2- Buy a ready-to-go Nexus node

## --> Contribute via Chromium (Browser on VPS)
You can install a Chromium browser on your Linux VPS and run a web-broswer based node on it too. [Guide to install Chromium on VPS](https://github.com/0xmoei/Install-Chromium-Linux-Browser)

* Open as many tabs as you want and run provers on all of them, LOL.
* I'm not sure about the performance but hey i'm just testing it.
* You'd better to have at least 1 CLI node near it too.

## --> Contribute via CLI
You might need a free +8GB RAM, you'd better to test it yourself since the testnet is under cunstructions
### 1. Install Dependecies
```bash
sudo apt update & sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install screen curl build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev git-all -y
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler -y
sudo apt update
```
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
```bash
rustup target add riscv32i-unknown-none-elf
```

### 2. Run Prover
**1- Start a screen to keep it running in the background**
```bash
screen -S nexus
```
**2- Install and run prover**
```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

**3- Run with an existing node ID**

```
source ~/.bashrc

nexus-network start --node-id your-node-id
```
* Replace `your-node-id` with the one acquired in the next step.

### 3. Create Node ID
* ---> **Node ID via Web:**

1- Go to https://app.nexus.xyz/nodes

2- Click `Add Node`, click `Add CLI Node` and copy your `node-id` and paste in terminal

* ---> **Node ID via CLI:**

1- Register your wallet address
```
source ~/.bashrc

nexus-network register-user --wallet-address your-wallet-address
```
* Replace `your-wallet-address` with your EVM wallet address

2- Create node ID
```
nexus-network register-node
```

3- Run node
```
source ~/.bashrc

nexus-network start
```
* The `register-user` and `register-node` commands will save your credentials to `~/.nexus/credentials.json`. To clear credentials, run:
```bash
nexus-network logout
```

### 4. Manage your Node screen:
* To minimze the screen: `CTRL+A+D`

* To return to screen: `screen -r nexus`

* To kill screen: `screen -XS nexus quit`

## Debugging
### Error: nexus-network: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.39' not found (required by nexus-network)
1- Confirm your installed GLIBC version:
```
ldd --version
```
* It must be `2.39`, if not, continue the steps.

2- Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gawk bison gcc make wget tar
```

3- Download GLIBC 2.39:
```
wget -c https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/glibc-2.39.tar.gz
tar -zxvf glibc-2.39.tar.gz
cd glibc-2.39
```

4- Create a build directory:
```
mkdir glibc-build
cd glibc-build
```

5- Build
```
../configure --prefix=/opt/glibc-2.39
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```
```
cd
```

6- Instead of running `nexus-network` command, run `/opt/glibc-2.39/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --library-path /opt/glibc-2.39/lib:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/local/bin/nexus-network`. For example: 
```
/opt/glibc-2.39/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --library-path /opt/glibc-2.39/lib:/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /root/.nexus/bin/nexus-network register-user --wallet-address your-wallet-address
```
*  Note, In the above command, my `nexus-network` directory is `/root/.nexus/bin/nexus-network`, if you got error in finding the correct nexus directory, run these:
```
source ~/.bashrc
which nexus-network
```
* Now replace `/root/.nexus/bin/nexus-network` with the output.
